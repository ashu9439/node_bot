# node_bot
Creating a Node.js bot to run locally stored shell scripts (`.sh` files) is possible. You can use the `child_process` module to execute shell commands and scripts. Here's an example:

1. Set up your Node.js environment:

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

2. Create a project directory and initialize it with npm:

```bash
mkdir local-script-bot
cd local-script-bot
npm init
```

Follow the prompts to create a `package.json` file for your project.

3. Install required dependencies:

In this example, you don't need external dependencies beyond the built-in Node.js modules.

4. Create your bot script:

Create a JavaScript file, e.g., `bot.js`, that will handle running local shell scripts:

```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');

const executeShellScript = (scriptPath) => {
  const command = `sh ${scriptPath}`;

  exec(command, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (error) {
      console.error(`Error executing shell script: ${error}`);
      return;
    }

    console.log(`Shell script output: ${stdout}`);
  });
};

// Example usage: Execute a local shell script named 'myscript.sh'.
executeShellScript('myscript.sh');
```

5. Create and store shell scripts:

Create shell script files (e.g., `myscript.sh`) containing the commands you want to run. For example:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, world!"
```

6. Run your bot:

To run your bot, execute the following command:

```bash
node bot.js
```

Your bot will execute the local shell script file (e.g., `myscript.sh`) and display the script's output in the console.

Please make sure to replace the example script path ('myscript.sh') with the actual path to your script. Be cautious when running shell scripts and ensure that you only run trusted scripts from trusted sources to avoid potential security risks associated with executing arbitrary commands.
