# node_bot

Certainly, I can provide you with a Node.js script that can run locally stored scripts. This script will use the `fs` (File System) module to read and execute JavaScript files stored locally on your server. Here's an example:

1. Set up your Node.js environment:

Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

2. Create a project directory and initialize it with npm:

```bash
mkdir local-script-bot
cd local-script-bot
npm init
```

Follow the prompts to create a `package.json` file for your project.

3. Install required dependencies:

In this example, you don't need any external dependencies beyond the built-in Node.js modules.

4. Create your bot script:

Create a JavaScript file, e.g., `bot.js`, that will handle loading and executing local scripts:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const executeScript = (scriptPath) => {
  try {
    const script = fs.readFileSync(scriptPath, 'utf8');
    const result = eval(script); // Execute the script
    console.log(`Script executed with result: ${result}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error while executing the script: ${error.message}`);
  }
};

// Example usage: Execute a local script named 'myscript.js'.
executeScript('myscript.js');
```

5. Create and store scripts:

You can create JavaScript files (e.g., `myscript.js`) containing the code you want to run. For example:

```javascript
const result = 2 + 2;
result;
```

6. Run your bot:

To run your bot, execute the following command:

```bash
node bot.js
```

Your bot will read and execute the local script file (e.g., `myscript.js`) and display the result in the console.

Please note that using `eval` to execute scripts can be risky if the scripts contain untrusted code. Make sure that you only run trusted scripts from trusted sources, and be cautious about potential security risks associated with running arbitrary code.
